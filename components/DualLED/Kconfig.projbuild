      Enable/disable component DualLED at Kconfig level.
      Variant gating is handled by environment variables (PORIS_ENABLE_DUALLED).

config DUALLED_USE_THREAD

    default n
    help
      If enabled, DualLED will create a FreeRTOS task and call spin()
      periodically. If disabled, call DualLED_spin() yourself from
      your scheduler.

config DUALLED_MINIMIZE_JITTER
    bool "Enable jitter minimization for execution cycles"
    default y
    help
      If active, the delay between loops will use vTaskDelayUntil() to guarantee long cycles will not shift the period, minimizing jitter.
      If deactivate, the component will use vTaskDelay() so the time it wait between cycles is the period.  Long cycles will introduce a shift in the period.

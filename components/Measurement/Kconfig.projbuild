      Enable/disable component Measurement at Kconfig level.
      Variant gating is handled by environment variables (PORIS_ENABLE_MEASUREMENT).

      If enabled, Measurement will create a FreeRTOS task and call spin()
      periodically. If disabled, call Measurement_spin() yourself from
      your scheduler.

    help
      If active, the delay between loops will use vTaskDelayUntil() to guarantee long cycles will not shift the period, minimizing jitter.
      If deactivate, the component will use vTaskDelay() so the time it wait between cycles is the period.  Long cycles will introduce a shift in the period.
